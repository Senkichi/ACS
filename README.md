# ACS Project Summary

- Using the Census.gov API (https://api.census.gov/data.html) we collected and stored ACS migration and housing data into a mongodb for deployment into a flask dashboard application

## Extraction, Transform

- In python we pulled Census.gov, kaggle.gov, data.gov, and Wikipedia data into a Pandas Dataframe
- We then combined our various df's into a master census dataframe
